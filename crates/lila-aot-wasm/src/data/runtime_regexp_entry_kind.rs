/// The closed domain the three `RUNTIME_REGEXP_ENTRY_KIND_*` words spell.

/// # Why this exists on top of [`RuntimeRegExpEntry`]
///
/// [`RuntimeRegExpEntry`] closes the **writer**: a fourth outcome is
/// `error[E0004]` at `append_runtime_regexp_program_table`. That bought nothing
/// on the **reader** side, which compared a raw `u64` against two of the three
/// constants. A fourth `RUNTIME_REGEXP_ENTRY_KIND_FOO = 3` would have compiled
/// cleanly next to its siblings and fallen through both comparisons in
/// `emit_runtime_regexp_program_slots` as a miss — reinstating, one level down,
/// the exact silent-skip class this table exists to remove.
///
/// So the *decision* the emitter makes is stated here, once, as an exhaustive
/// match ([`Self::throws_syntax_error`]), and the emitter builds its comparison
/// chain by iterating [`Self::ALL`]. Adding a variant is then a compile error at
/// two exhaustive matches in this file, and the emitted comparison follows
/// automatically rather than being one more transcription.
///
/// Residual, stated rather than papered over: [`Self::ALL`] is hand-written.
/// The compiler cannot enumerate a Rust enum, so the trigger to extend it is
/// the `error[E0004]` a new variant produces at the two matches below.
