//! Consolidated integration tests. Artifact, function-body, size and emission tests over compiled
//! programs, plus the byte-identity golden capture.
//!
//! One binary per area: every integration-test binary links the emitter and the ICU data, so
//! a few area targets cost far less disk and link time than one target per file. Each module
//! is one former test file; run just one with `-- <module>::`.
