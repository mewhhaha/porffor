//! The iterator-protocol obligations of ECMA-262 7.4, and the witnesses that
//! iterator-consuming IR carries to say how each obligation is discharged.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! This module makes every discharge a named value in the IR, so that
//!
//! - relying on one is a construction that a reviewer sees, not a silence;
//! - adding another specialization cannot compile until its author says, for
//!   all four obligations, whether the specialization *emits* the operation or
//!   *assumes it away*, and on which premise;
//! - transposing two obligations is `E0308` rather than a plausible-looking
//!   wrong witness — including *inside this module*, because the four discharge
//!   newtypes are what [`IteratorProtocolWitness::new`] takes.
//!
//! ## What a premise is, and what it is not
//!
//! - [`PremiseKind::ImplementationFact`] — a proposition about *our emitter*,
//!   established by reading it. Recorded so the reader knows no guard is owed.
//! - [`PremiseKind::Vacuous`] — there is nothing to discharge.
//!
//! ## The emitter must not read this
//!
//! No `lila-aot-wasm` arm consults the witness, and now it cannot: every
//! reader of a witness's contents is `pub(crate)`, so a backend arm that binds
//! `protocol` and branches on `is_fully_emitted()` is `E0624` at `cargo check`
//! rather than a ten-minute rung-G diff. The type stays `pub` only because it
//! is the type of a `pub` enum variant's field.
//!
//! See `docs/rust-rewrite/contracts/Spec-operation catalog evidence and the
//! iterator-protocol obligation witness.md`.
