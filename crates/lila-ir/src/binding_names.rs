//! The module binding-name domains: `[[LocalName]]`, `[[ExportName]]` and the
//! merged storage name.
//!
//! ECMA-262 gives an ImportEntry Record (16.2.1.4) and an ExportEntry Record
//! (16.2.1.5) *different* name fields with different definitions:
//! `[[LocalName]]` is "the name that is used to locally access the imported
//! value from within the importing module", while `[[ExportName]]` is "the name
//! used to export this binding by this module". `export { a as b }` is the
//! production that makes them differ, and `ResolveExport` (16.2.1.6.2) matches
//! on one and returns the other.
//!
//! This compiler adds a third domain the specification does not have. `modules::link`
//! merges every unit's *source text* into one Script and lowers it once, so all
//! units' top-level bindings share one activation environment (the three reasons
//! are stated in that module, and the load-bearing one — a cross-module read
//! becoming an ordinary read of the exporter's own cell — is what makes an
//! imported binding live without runtime indirection). The name a binding is
//! spelled by in that one merged scope is the **merged name**.
//!
//! ```text
//! D1  [[LocalName]]   LocalName    a name in one module's own environment
//! D2  [[ExportName]]  ExportName   a name in a module's export table
//! D3  merged name     MergedName   a name in the single merged Script scope
//! ```
//!
//! `[[ImportName]]` is **not** a fourth domain: 16.2.1.4 defines it as "the name
//! under which the desired binding is exported by the module identified by
//! `[[ModuleRequest]]`", i.e. a `[[ExportName]]` read from the other side, and
//! `ResolveExport(target, importName)` passes it straight in as `exportName`.
//! So [`ImportNameIr::Name`](crate::ImportNameIr::Name) carries an
//! [`ExportName`].
//!
//! D3 has exactly two generators and no others:
//!
//! * [`LocalName::merged_in`] for a source binding. It applies **no** prefix —
//!   the merge shares cells by name on purpose — so it is the identity except
//!   for `*default*`, which becomes `$d{unit}$`.
//! * [`MergedName::minted`] for a compiler-owned per-unit cell, whose role
//!   ranges over the closed set [`UnitCellRole`] rather than over any source
//!   name.
//!
//! There is deliberately **no** `MergedName::prefixed(unit, &LocalName)`: no
//! function anywhere takes a `[[LocalName]]` and returns a `$m{unit}$`-prefixed
//! name, so "apply the prefix twice" is not an expression that can be written.
//!
//! Deliberately absent from all three name types, and deliberately never to be
//! added: `Display`, `AsRef<str>`, `Deref<Target = str>`, `FromStr`, `Default`,
//! and `From<…> for String`. A stringification must name `as_str()`,
//! `spec_name()` or `merged_in(..)` at the call site — `format!("{name}")` would
//! otherwise quietly reintroduce the `String` domain these types replace, and
//! here it would reintroduce it *with the wrong answer*, since `spec_name()` and
//! `merged_in()` differ exactly on the case that matters.
//!
//! See `docs/rust-rewrite/contracts/Module binding-name domains: [[LocalName]] vs
//! [[ExportName]] vs merged storage name.md`.
