# Rung 1c -- the whole `lila-cli --test cli` suite -- as RESUMABLE per-module
# chunks.
#
# usage:
#   setsid ./scripts/rung1c-chunks.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 </dev/null &
#   disown
#
# Re-run it verbatim after a container restart. It skips every chunk already
# banked in the done-file and continues with the next one.
#
# # Why this exists as a tracked script
#
# The suite is ~2.5 h on a 4-CPU box, libtest has NO resume, and this container
# restarts about hourly. Four consecutive single-invocation attempts died
# mid-run (batch 3 twice at 15 tests, batch 4 at 44 tests); the first chunked
# attempt banked 262 of 593 and then died too -- but it lost only the chunk in
# flight. Chunking is what makes rung 1c reachable at all here.
#
# That machinery previously lived in `target/watched/b4c-rung1c.sh`, which is
# gitignored, so every batch re-derived it from a lane note and rung 1c has
# never survived a restart as a repeatable artefact. The SCRIPT is what needs
# tracking. Its run state (the done-file, the logs, the results file) correctly
# stays under `target/`.
#
# `docs/rust-rewrite/batch-workflow.md` section "Rung 1c terminates, and checks
# its own expectations" is the reference for what a green run means.
#
# # Three load-bearing properties. Do not "simplify" any of them.
#
# 1. `--test-threads=3`, NEVER 1. libtest names each worker thread after the
#    test it runs, and `known_failures::execution_path` routes on that name.
#    Under `--test-threads=1` every test runs on the thread named `main`, the
#    name is unavailable, and all ~600 tests fall back to spawning a cold `lila`
#    child instead of the warm in-process call the runtime estimate is built on.
#    It is still correct and terminating, just far slower. For one test use
#    `-- --exact <name>`, not a lower thread count.
#
# 2. libtest filters are SUBSTRINGS, not exact names. `array::` therefore also
#    selects `typed_array::`, so the array chunk carries `--skip typed_array::`
#    and nothing is counted twice. THE GENERAL RULE, because this will recur:
#    if a new area module's stem ends with an existing one (`sub_array` ends
#    with `array`), the shorter chunk must skip the longer one. This is checked
#    by `known_failures::rung_1c_chunks_cover_every_cli_area_module`, which
#    reads the `run_chunk` lines below back out of this file -- so a chunk set
#    that no longer partitions the suite is a red test, not a silent subset.
#
# 3. THE DONE-FILE *IS* THE RESUME STATE. Do not "clean it up" between runs.
#    Deleting it re-runs hours of already-banked work. A TARGETED invalidation
#    (removing the line for a chunk whose subsystem a lane has since rewritten)
#    is legitimate and is how a stale verdict is retired; deleting the whole
#    file is not. See "the counts sidecar" below for the half of that judgement
#    the script can now make on its own.
#
# 4. A CHUNK IS BANKED ONLY WHEN IT PRODUCED A VERDICT. Exit 124 (the stall
#    guard SIGKILLed it), a missing log, a missing `test result:` line, or
#    `running 0 tests` all leave the chunk out of the done-file and make the
#    script exit 1 with RUN INCOMPLETE. It used to bank on every exit status,
#    which meant a killed chunk was skipped forever and the run still printed
#    ALL CHUNKS DONE -- a chunk that measured nothing, recorded as measured.
#    A libtest FAILURE is a verdict and IS banked; that is the point of the run.
#
# # The partition is the whole claim
#
# Every test runs exactly once and the union of the chunks is the suite, so a
# chunked run is a complete rung 1c rather than a subset. The arithmetic that
# proves it, per chunk: `N passed + N filtered out` must equal the compiled test
# count reported by `cargo test -p lila-cli --test cli -- --list | tail -1`.
# Recount the source side with the EXACT-line form (a substring
# `grep '#\[test\]'` over-counts, because prose in `known_failures.rs` names the
# attribute):
#
#   awk '/^[[:space:]]*#\[test\][[:space:]]*$/{n++} END{print n}' \
#     crates/lila-cli/tests/cli/*.rs
#
# minus the `#[cfg(feature = "spec-exec-oracle")]`-gated tests in `frontend.rs`.
#
# What chunking gives up, stated plainly: whole-suite ordering/interference
# effects, and a single `test result:` line. Neither is what the known-failures
# ledger needs -- it needs the failing set, with messages.
#
# # Budget, measured on this 4-CPU box rather than estimated
#
# Per-module cost spans 6.8 s/test (`heap`) to 38 s/test (`date`). Add ~900 s of
# dead wall-clock in `binary_data::` for the declared T17 `Atomics.wait` hang,
# which `tests/cli/main.rs` converts into a bounded failure. `LILA_CPU_PERCENT=100`
# below is load-bearing: `scripts/run-watched.sh` routes through
# `scripts/capped.sh`, which silently pins to half the CPUs and made an earlier
# attempt look 2x slower than it was.

# THE COUNTS SIDECAR -- `<chunk> <#[test] count of its module when it banked>`.
#
# The done-file records THAT a chunk was measured; it cannot record WHAT was
# measured, and that gap has a live cost. A chunk banked at 16 tests stays
# banked after a lane adds a 17th to the same module: the resume skips it, the
# run prints ALL CHUNKS DONE, and the new test has never executed. That is the
# same class of defect as banking a chunk that selected zero tests (property 4),
# arriving from the other direction, and it is not hypothetical -- batch 5
# banked `date` at 16 tests and batch 6 added a 17th in the same file.
#
# So the skip predicate is "banked AND its module still declares the same number
# of tests", and a chunk whose module has grown or shrunk re-runs. The count is
# the same exact-line `awk` form the hygiene scanner uses, over the one file the
# chunk selects. It is a FINGERPRINT, not an assertion about the suite: it
# deliberately counts `#[cfg]`-gated tests too (only `frontend.rs` has any).
#
# WHAT IT SEES IS THE COUNT, AND ONLY THE COUNT. An earlier draft of this
# paragraph said it "moves whenever the module's source does", which is false and
# was read as a stronger guarantee than the mechanism has. `module_test_count` is
# a pure `awk` tally of `#[test]` attributes in one file, so a RENAME, a BODY
# REWRITE, or a delete-one-add-one leaves the fingerprint fixed and the stale
# verdict banked. That is not hypothetical: batch 6 rewrote
# `crates/lila-cli/tests/cli/iterator_helpers.rs` by 114 lines and only the
# incidental 13 -> 14 test count made this guard fire. Had the rewrite kept 13
# tests, nine red fixtures would have stayed banked as red while the repair sat
# in the tree -- the `date` case this sidecar is advertised on, mirrored.
#
# Two classes therefore still need the hand-deleted done-file line (property 3):
#
#   * a same-count edit to the module, per the paragraph above;
#   * a COMPILER change, which no count over the test sources can detect.
#
# The strictly stronger mechanism is a content hash --
# `cksum "crates/lila-cli/tests/cli/$1.rs" | awk '{print $1}'` drops into
# `module_test_count`'s shape unchanged, including its fail-open 0. It is not
# taken here because switching the fingerprint invalidates every recorded row at
# once and forces a full 20-chunk re-run (~2.5 h); do it at the START of a batch
# with no banked verdicts to lose, never mid-resume.
#
# The two unknown cases are deliberately resolved in OPPOSITE directions, and
# the difference is which way the unknown can lie:
#
#   * AN UNREADABLE MODULE (count 0) keeps its banked verdict and prints a
#     warning. A read error is a bug in this script, and a bug here must not
#     cost hours of re-run.
#   * A CHUNK WITH NO RECORDED COUNT RE-RUNS. It used to be grandfathered --
#     recorded at whatever the tree declares today and skipped -- which blesses
#     unmeasured work as measured, the exact vacuous pass this sidecar exists to
#     close. `touch "$COUNTS"` below recreates the file empty, so losing only
#     the sidecar while the done-file survived took EVERY banked chunk down that
#     path. When we do not know what a verdict measured, we measure it again.

# THE STALL BUDGET IS PER CHUNK, because one chunk does not fit the default.
#
# `run-watched.sh` judges liveness ONLY by growth of the chunk's log file. Its
# own heartbeat `printf` goes to run-watched's stdout and never into that log
# (`run-watched.sh:86`), and `frontend_test262_subset`'s child has its stdout
# swallowed by `.output()`, so between libtest's single "has been running for
# over 60 seconds" warning and the final `test result:` line NOTHING reaches the
# log. The budget for a one-test chunk is therefore exactly `60 + stall`.
#
# MEASURED, and this is why 900 is wrong for that chunk. b5's last `frontend`
# attempt did not die of memory at all -- it died on this guard:
# `target/watched/b5r4-rung1c-driver.log` shows the test still unfinished when
# run-watched killed the run ("no output for 900s after 1335s"), having started
# at ~375 s. That is >= 960 s of runtime with the DEFAULT 4 workers on an
# otherwise idle box, against a 60 + 900 = 960 s ceiling. `--threads 2` in
# `tests/cli/frontend_test262_subset.rs` serialises the compiles further, so it
# can only move that number the wrong way.
#
# Isolation makes the chunk schedulable; it does not make it fit. A one-test
# chunk is also the case where the guard buys least: there is nothing else the
# silence could be hiding, and the chunk's failure mode on a real hang is an
# hour of wall clock rather than a corrupted verdict.
#
# THE MEASUREMENT IS IN, and 3600 stays. Batch 6 ran the isolated chunk alone
# with the sweep down (`target/watched/rung1c-frontend_test262_subset.log`):
# libtest's single "over 60 seconds" warning lands at t+60 s, the next byte
# written to that log is the `... ok` at t+1814 s, so the log is silent for
# **1,754 s** and the chunk banks at `ran=1 filtered_out=608 sum=609`. The old
# 900 s ceiling would have killed it at ~t+960 s, 854 s short -- which is
# exactly the b5 arithmetic above, now confirmed prospectively rather than
# reconstructed. 3600 is a 2.05x margin over the measured silence: do not lower
# it below ~2600, and re-measure rather than re-argue if the test's cost moves.
#
# Peak RSS in the same run was 5.55 GiB (plateau 4.87-5.03 GiB) against b5's
# 8.4-8.7 GiB for the same test unisolated, with `avail` never below 9.05 GiB.
# That is what `--threads 2` bought; it is recorded here because it is the
# number that decides whether this chunk can ever share the box with the sweep,
# and that co-scheduling has NOT been tested.

  #
  # What they DO buy: the CLI suite compiles hundreds of distinct sources, and
  # the module and program tiers are keyed by source text, so they are pure
  # write-and-prune churn here while the function-stencil tier is keyed per
  # function and converges.
  #
  # THE VALUES ARE THIS BOX'S, NOT THE DEV MACHINE'S, and that is deliberate.
  # Batch 6 first wrote 8 GiB / 512 MiB / 512 MiB here, copying the shape of the
  # sweep invocation in `docs/rust-rewrite/batch-workflow.md` (32 GiB function
  # tier). Two measurements say that is wrong on this container:
  #
  #   * THE CACHE IS ONE SHARED DIRECTORY. `lila_cache_root()` is
  #     `$LILA_CACHE_DIR` or `~/.cache/lila`, with no per-process keying,
  #     so the Test262 sweep and every CLI-test child manage the SAME bytes. The
  #     supervisor actually running on this box
  #     (`target/test262-scratch/sweep-supervisor.sh`, and confirmed in
  #     `/proc/<pid>/environ` of the live process) uses
  #     1 GiB / 64 MiB / 64 MiB. A chunk that let the shared directory grow to
  #     8 GiB would hand the next sweep process 7+ GiB to prune back to 70 % of
  #     ITS 1 GiB budget: two processes with different budgets over one
  #     directory undo each other's sizing.
  #   * THE DISK IS A FIXED PER-SESSION ALLOWANCE. Measured 2026-08-10: 19 GiB
  #     available, `target/debug` alone 7.3 GiB, `~/.cache/lila` 948 MiB (at
  #     the sweep's cap). An 8 GiB tier is a third of the remaining allowance
  #     spent on a cache, and "no space left on device" mid-chunk looks like
  #     anything but a disk problem.
  #
  # So: match the sweep exactly. The function tier equals the `cache.rs` default
  # (1 GiB), and the only real movement is the module and program tiers DOWN to
  # 64 MiB from the 512 MiB default -- which is the actual hygiene win here,
  # because those two are keyed by source text and never serve a hit across
  # distinct fixtures. Raise the function tier only together with the sweep
  # supervisor's, and only after checking `df` on this session.
  #
  # This is the ONLY correct place for them. Every limit is memoised in a
  # `OnceLock` on first use, so `std::env::set_var` inside a test is both useless
  # (an earlier test in the same process may already have resolved it) and
  # unsound under libtest's threads. Set here, it is inherited by `cargo test`,
  # by the test binary, and by every `lila` child it spawns -- which covers both
  # the in-process and the guarded execution paths at once.

# it, and the invariant list forbids editing `known_failures.rs`, so the hygiene
# tests cannot carry this either. This costs ~1 ms and names the reason.

# Fail-closed on a read error is deliberate here, unlike `run_chunk`'s skip
# path: if that file cannot be read the chunk would select zero tests and never
# bank anyway, so exiting with the reason beats exiting without one.

# so this has no ordering dependency on anything, and the hygiene test does not

# THE LANGUAGE TRIO. One module until batch 7, and the only chunk that had never
# produced a verdict at any head in four batches.
#
# `language::` OOMed as a single 105-test libtest process THREE times (batch 6,
# 22:43Z / 23:29Z / 00:30Z): SIGKILL at t+1200 s after 66, 75 and 75 tests, with
# `avail` falling MONOTONICALLY 8.5 GiB at ~7 tests -> 3.56 GiB at ~49 ->
# 1.14 GiB two minutes before the kill. Monotonic, not a plateau: that is
# cumulative growth across the process, rather than a three-in-flight working
# set. (`frontend_test262_subset`'s flat 5.55 GiB used to be cited as the
# contrast; it is a CHILD process's RSS and is not evidence about a libtest
# process at all -- see below.) Every runner-level knob was tried and measured:
#
#   * per-tier cache limits at 256/64/64 MiB -- NO EFFECT, same trajectory. They
#     bound bytes on disk (`lila-engine/src/cache.rs`), not RSS.
#   * `LILA_CPU_PERCENT` -- overridden by `run_chunk` above, and a CPU share
#     is not a memory lever anyway.
#   * `--test-threads` below 3 -- BANNED by property 1 at the top of this file.
#
# That list is three ENVIRONMENT knobs, and an earlier version of this comment
# called the split "the only remaining lever" on the strength of it. It is not:
# the list never examined in-process retention, and there is a named CANDIDATE
# mechanism there. `WASM_MODULE_MEMORY_CACHE_ENTRIES` (`lila-engine/src/lib.rs:74`)
# bounds an LRU of fully compiled Wasmtime modules BY ENTRY COUNT AND BY NOTHING
# ELSE -- 64 entries, no byte ceiling -- and the in-process path these tests take
# retains into it, i.e. one native module per distinct fixture. That is why the
# three DISK knobs did nothing.
#
# It is a hypothesis, and it does NOT survive the banked chunks. Counted from
# `target/watched/rung1c-done-counts` plus the current sources:
#
#   array       banked 84, ProcessCommand 0, .arg("run") 84, 77 distinct
#               fixtures, mean 1,945 B  -- pins the 64-entry LRU at its cap
#   typed_array banked 58, ProcessCommand 0, .arg("run") 58, 48 distinct
#               fixtures, mean 2,716 B  -- sits INSIDE the 53/62/62 band
#   language    never banked, 33 distinct fixtures, mean 1,285 B
#
# Both of the first two banked, with LARGER sources. So retained-entry count
# does not explain the `language` OOM, and the ~0.118 GiB/test line below does
# not either (it projects `array` at ~9.9 GiB). The real variable is
# unidentified; per-fixture BYTES of native code is the obvious suspect and is
# exactly what an entry-count LRU does not bound.
#
# Two figures the earlier version reasoned from are also wrong. 53 / 62 / 62 is
# `tests_done - 13`, which assumes one distinct fixture per test -- the 105
# tests reference 81 distinct fixtures, so those are over-counts, not
# measurements. And `frontend_test262_subset`'s flatness is not evidence about
# an in-process LRU: its single call is `ProcessCommand::new(...)`
# (`frontend_test262_subset.rs:123`), a real child, so the 5.55 GiB plateau is
# the child's RSS across hundreds of test262 cases.
#
# `LILA_MODULE_MEMORY_CACHE_ENTRIES` now overrides the bound; bounding it by
# bytes is the standing follow-up, and `LILA_MODULE_MEMORY_CACHE_ENTRIES=8`
# on one `language*` chunk is the cheap experiment that would settle the
# paragraph above. Until it runs, do not justify a sizing decision by it.
#
# Fewer tests per process is still the lever this split reaches for, and the
# split has to be by MODULE FILE rather than by filter:
# `known_failures::rung_1c_chunks` asserts each chunk's second argument is
# exactly `<name>::` and that anything further is `--skip <other>::`, so an
# `--exact` name list is rejected at rung 0.
#
# Sizing rests on ONE direct measurement: the standalone 30-name tail COMPLETED
# in a fresh process (30 in 498.2 s, 16.6 s/test) where 75 tests in 1200 s
# (16.0 s/test) did not. ~30 heavy tests per process is therefore a size that
# has been observed to finish, which is why there are three chunks. The `avail`
# trajectory (~0.118 GiB/test) agrees but does not support it, per the
# counterevidence above.
#
# `language` also keeps its 13 "cheap" tests, but NOT because they run out of
# process: only `build_wasm_succeeds_for_dynamic_fractional_exponentiation_fixture`
# uses `ProcessCommand`. The other five `build_wasm_*` and all six `inspect_*`
# call `crate::Command`, which dispatches in-process
# (`tests/cli/main.rs:186-215`). They are cheap because `build wasm` and
# `inspect` never reach `WasmModuleMemoryCachePolicy::Retain` -- that is on the
# `run` path only -- so they add no cache entry, though they do add transient
# RSS. Distinct fixtures per module, the unit an entry-count LRU would care
# about, are 32 / 21 / 28, not the 45 / 29 / 31 test counts.
#
# NO `--skip` IS NEEDED AND NONE MAY BE ADDED. The overlap rule fires only when
# `format!("{other}::").ends_with(&format!("{chunk}::"))`, and
# `"language_errors::".ends_with("language::")` is FALSE -- the character after
# `language` is `_`, not `:`. That is exactly why `array` carries
# `--skip typed_array::` and these three do not. By the same token libtest's
# substring filter `language::` does not select `language_errors::…`, so these
# run as THREE SEPARATE PROCESSES, which is the entire point: the accumulation
# is per-process. Do not rename any of the three so that one stem becomes a
# `::`-suffix of another.
#
# Stall budget: all three grow their log on every `... ok`, so the default
# `RUNG1C_STALL=900` is adequate and none of them needs a `chunk_stall` entry.
# Projected wall clock from 16.3 s/test: ~590 s / ~480 s / ~515 s.
#
# SCHEDULING: like `date::`, do not co-schedule these with the Test262 sweep.
# The twice-confirmed law is that the sweep (~4.4 GiB) and a heavy CLI chunk do
# not fit in 15.7 GiB together, and `language` OOMed on an IDLE box.
