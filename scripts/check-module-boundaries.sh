# Non-test CODE lines: everything before the crate's `#[cfg(test)]` block, minus
# blank lines and minus whole-line comments (`//`, `///`, `//!` and lines inside
# a whole-line `/* ... */` block).
#
# Blanks and comments are excluded because of what this budget is FOR: it exists
# so implementation cannot creep back into a crate root that is supposed to hold
# nothing but `mod`, `use` and `pub use`. Counting documentation against that
# budget makes the guard punish the one thing a re-export surface most needs.
# Measured at batch 6: `porffor-ir/src/lib.rs` was 169 raw lines and RED against
# a budget of 140, while its code was 140 lines exactly — every line over the
# limit was a doc comment pointing a re-exported contract type at its
# `docs/rust-rewrite/contracts/` file, added by the theory rounds. Raising the
# number instead would have ratcheted the budget for a file that had not grown.
#
# THIS IS A LOOSENING OF EVERY `check_orchestration_surface` BUDGET, not only of
# the one that motivated it. Each budget below is now read against a code-only
# count; a number chosen against the old raw count is therefore no longer the
# limit it was written to be, and each is annotated at its call site with what it
# measures today.
#
# The block-comment rule is a state machine rather than the `^[[:space:]]*\*`
# heuristic it replaces. That heuristic dropped any line whose first non-space
# character is `*` — a `*slot = value;` deref statement, a continued expression —
# so the count could silently UNDER-report real code for any file this script
# guards, in the one direction that turns a red budget green without anyone
# editing the budget. Only whole-line block comments are skipped; a `/* ... */`
# that opens after code on the same line still counts that line, which is the
# conservative direction.
