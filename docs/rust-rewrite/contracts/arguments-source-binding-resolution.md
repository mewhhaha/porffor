# Arguments source binding resolution

Authority: ECMA-262 `5345883164f463e87f8b40aca4956157ecba8783`,
FunctionDeclarationInstantiation, ResolveBinding, Declarative Environment Records
and destructuring assignment evaluation. An ordinary function's implicit
arguments binding precedes an outer/global binding with that name. A simple
function's `var arguments` reuses the initialized arguments value. Parameter
expressions keep their separate parameter/body environments. Arrows observe
the mutable lexical binding; they do not retain a copy of its old value.

The historical actual `aee6bc109` compiler records Bugs in sloppy modes of
`language/statements/function/S13_A15_T4.js` and `S13_A15_T5.js`, plus three
`language/statements/for-await-of/` destructuring cases targeting `arguments`.
Read fallback selects an ArgumentsObject while writes resolve a different
source/global slot, and an outer global can precede the own-arguments fallback.

Units referencing `arguments` now retain named environment visibility. All
source reads/writes/destructuring and closure references use the existing live
ResolveBinding path, preserving with, eval, parameter and lexical precedence.
The existing hidden arguments slot is exported under its source name when no
real source declaration masks it. A simple source `var arguments` slot starts
with the protocol's initialized ArgumentsObject value rather than undefined;
all source accesses then share that published cell. Real parameters, root
function declarations and separate body records retain their existing ordering.
This deliberately uses the complete named-record path instead of adding a
partial hidden-slot alias with stale capture/value metadata.

Controls cover own/global collision, var-without-initializer, reassignment and
escaping arrows, destructuring in async functions/generators, parameter and
lexical shadows, and with precedence. The original executions and every prior
passing inventory remain required. This is prepared source; the wider named
environment transition requires complete affected native verification.
