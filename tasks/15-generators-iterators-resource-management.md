# T15 — Generators, iterators, iterator helpers and resource management

**Status:** In progress — iterator helpers and generator records exist; general suspension remains

**Parallel group:** Feature lane  
**Depends on:** T04, T05, T08, T09; async portions also depend on T14  
**Blocks:** Iterator-dependent closure across arrays, collections, promises and modules

## Current repository state

Generator activation/delegation records, iterator operations, several iterator
helpers, async-iterator support and resource-management builtins now exist.
Some generator and helper behavior is still handled through focused
materialization, and the README records unsupported suspended/control-flow
families. General sync/async generator state machines, iterator-close coverage
across all consumers and complete resource-management filters remain open.

The generator-yield IR now distinguishes `yield` from `yield*` with the closed
`YieldForm` domain. Its delegation case carries a one-inhabitant
`GeneratorDelegationProtocol`, which is compile-time tied to all four iterator
obligations and to the sync/async delegation emitter family. The parser-facing
delegation boolean is converted exactly once where `StatementIr` is built;
backend consumers match the closed form exhaustively. This seam is covered by
the green central feature-enabled CLI compile without changing
`generator_delegation.rs`; focused yield execution remains unverified, and
this is not a claim that the broader generator or iterator-close acceptance
criteria are complete.

Call-argument spread now has the same compile-enforced boundary:
`ExprIr::SpreadArgument` carries a `SpreadArgumentIr`, whose required
one-inhabitant `SpreadArgumentProtocol` is tied through the iterator-operation
catalog to `emit_call_args_vector`. The witness credits only the operations the
emitter performs (`GetIterator`, `IteratorStep`, `IteratorValue`) and records
the no-`IteratorClose` path as an implementation fact. Adding a new spread IR
construction without that protocol is therefore a build error; the backend
does not branch on the witness, so evaluation order and emitted control flow
are unchanged. The central feature-enabled CLI compile covers this seam;
focused spread execution remains unverified.

Array-literal spread remains a separate correctness gap. The intended closed
decision is `ArraySpreadStrategy::{ProvenDense, GeneralIterator}`, but the
current compiler cannot honestly construct `ProvenDense`: a dense inferred
array shape says nothing about a patched `%Array.prototype%[@@iterator]`, and
the available `array_prototype_mutated` fact starts conservative (`true`) and
has no proven-intact transition. Encoding a never-reachable fast path would not
make a plausible mistake fail to compile. Until lowering gains a realm/version
witness (or deletes the shortcut in favor of a direct general iterator
accumulator), known-Array `[].concat(...)` desugaring remains open and must not
be described as protocol-equivalent.

## Objective

Implement resumable generator execution, the complete iterator protocols, iterator helpers and explicit resource management through reusable state-machine and iterator-operation layers.

## Generator state machines

Lower generator bodies into explicit states with stored environments, operand values, completion records and finally/handler state. Cover:

- generator function/method object creation and prototypes;
- `next`, `return`, `throw`, suspended-start/yield/completed/executing states;
- `yield` and `yield*` delegation, including missing methods and iterator closing;
- re-entrancy errors;
- `try/catch/finally`, return and throw across suspension;
- captured variables, `this`, `arguments`, `super` and private environment;
- async generators by composing the state machine with T14 jobs/promises.

Do not implement generators by interpreting a stored AST at runtime.

## Iterator operations

Complete and centralize:

- `GetIterator`/`GetIteratorFromMethod` for sync and async hints;
- iterator records, `IteratorNext`, `IteratorComplete`, `IteratorValue`, `IteratorStep`;
- `IteratorClose` and `AsyncIteratorClose` with correct completion precedence;
- `%IteratorPrototype%`, `%AsyncIteratorPrototype%` and identity methods;
- array, string, typed-array, Map/Set and custom iterator interoperability.

All consumers (`for-of`, spread, destructuring, Promise combinators, constructors and builtins) must use these operations.

## Iterator helpers

Implement the pinned Iterator/AsyncIterator helper APIs, including lazy helper objects, `map`, `filter`, `take`, `drop`, `flatMap`, `reduce`, `toArray`, `forEach`, `some`, `every`, `find`, helper `return`, close behavior, limits/coercions and branding.

## Explicit resource management

Implement current standardized syntax/builtins present in the pin:

- `using` and `await using` declaration lowering;
- `Symbol.dispose`/`Symbol.asyncDispose`;
- `DisposableStack`, `AsyncDisposableStack` and `SuppressedError` integration;
- LIFO disposal, move/adopt/defer/use, abrupt-completion chaining and async disposal jobs.

Coordinate syntax/early errors with T07 and error objects with T24.

## Acceptance criteria

- Generator protocol/state/re-entrancy tests pass.
- `yield*` handles sync and async delegates, return/throw absence and close precedence.
- All iterator consumers close iterators on the exact required abrupt paths.
- Iterator helpers are lazy and pass mutation/close/branding tests.
- Explicit resource management preserves suppression order and disposal timing.
- Generator/iterator objects remain valid across GC cycles.
- Pinned generator, iterator-helper and resource-management filters reach zero failures.

## Required tests

```sh
cargo test -p lila-ir generator_ --quiet
cargo test -p lila-aot-wasm iterator_ --quiet
cargo test -p lila-cli wasm_iterator --quiet
./target/debug/lila test262 run built-ins/Iterator --execution-backend wasm --timeout-ms 120000 --threads 4
```

Also run language generator/`yield`, `for-of`, spread/destructuring, AsyncIterator, DisposableStack, AsyncDisposableStack and explicit-resource-management filters.
